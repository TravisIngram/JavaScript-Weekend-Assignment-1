# Prime Weekend Challenge 1

## Hey Primers! 

For the challenge this weekend, you will be creating an application that will process insurance claims.

We will provided you with an array of 5 items.  You will use the `constructor function` to create 5 more and then combine the two into one array of 10 items.

To complete this challenge, you will need to create two functions.

* First, determine what _percentage_ (per the rules below) of the insurance claim will be covered.

* Second, determine what the specific _dollar amount_ (based on the `visitCost` value) will be.

Within your cost determining method, log out a message in the following format, `'Paid out $xxx for xxpaitentxx.'`.

Finally, log out the entire amount paid to the customer.

All numbers should be rounded to the nearest whole number!
